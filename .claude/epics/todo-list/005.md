# Task: Implement progress tracking and visual indicators

## Description
Create the task completion rate calculation and visual progress indicator. Display real-time progress updates as users complete or uncomplete tasks, with an attractive progress visualization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Calculate completion percentage accurately
- [ ] Display progress as visual progress bar or similar indicator
- [ ] Show completion rate as percentage text
- [ ] Update progress in real-time as tasks change
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no tasks, all completed, etc.)
- [ ] Include smooth animations for progress changes

## Technical Details
- Calculate percentage: completed tasks / total tasks * 100
- Create responsive progress bar with CSS animations
- Listen for task state changes to update progress
- Handle division by zero when no tasks exist
- Use CSS transforms for smooth progress bar animations
- Consider circular progress indicator or linear progress bar

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Task creation and display needed for progress calculation
- [ ] Task 004: Task completion needed for progress updates

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (requires task management functionality)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Progress percentage calculates correctly
- [ ] Visual progress indicator displays attractively
- [ ] Progress updates immediately with task changes
- [ ] Edge cases (0 tasks, 100% complete) handled gracefully
- [ ] Animations are smooth and performant
- [ ] Progress persists across browser sessions
