# Task: Implement progress tracking and visual indicators

## Description
Create the task completion rate calculation and visual progress indicator. Display real-time progress updates as users complete or uncomplete tasks, with an attractive progress visualization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Calculate completion percentage accurately
- [x] Display progress as visual progress bar or similar indicator
- [x] Show completion rate as percentage text
- [x] Update progress in real-time as tasks change
- [x] Handle edge cases (no tasks, all completed, etc.)
- [x] Include smooth animations for progress changes

## Technical Details
- Calculate percentage: completed tasks / total tasks * 100
- Create responsive progress bar with CSS animations
- Listen for task state changes to update progress
- Handle division by zero when no tasks exist
- Use CSS transforms for smooth progress bar animations
- Consider circular progress indicator or linear progress bar

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Task creation and display needed for progress calculation
- [ ] Task 004: Task completion needed for progress updates

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (requires task management functionality)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Progress percentage calculates correctly
- [x] Visual progress indicator displays attractively
- [x] Progress updates immediately with task changes
- [x] Edge cases (0 tasks, 100% complete) handled gracefully
- [x] Animations are smooth and performant
- [x] Progress persists across browser sessions

## Implementation Notes
- Circular progress indicator with smooth CSS animations
- Real-time calculation and updates on task state changes
- Graceful handling of edge cases (0 tasks, 100% completion)
- Visual stats showing total and completed task counts
