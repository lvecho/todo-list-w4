# Task: Implement localStorage data layer and task model

## Description
Create the data persistence layer using localStorage and define the task data model. Implement utility functions for CRUD operations, data validation, and error handling for storage quota limitations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define task data model with id, text, completed, createdAt, updatedAt fields
- [x] Create localStorage utility functions (get, set, remove, clear)
- [x] Implement task CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Add input sanitization for XSS prevention
- [x] Handle localStorage quota exceeded errors gracefully
- [x] Implement data migration/versioning support

## Technical Details
- Use UUID or timestamp-based IDs for tasks
- Implement storage wrapper for error handling and fallbacks
- Add data validation before storage operations
- Include storage quota monitoring
- Files: scripts/storage.js, scripts/models.js
- Use ES6 modules if separate files, or single scripts/app.js

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - can be developed independently of UI

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [x] All CRUD operations work reliably
- [x] Data persists across browser sessions
- [x] Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- [x] Storage errors are handled gracefully
- [x] Code includes comprehensive error handling
- [x] Data model supports future extensions

## Implementation Notes
- StorageManager class with comprehensive error handling
- TaskModel class with UUID-based IDs and timestamps
- XSS prevention through textContent and HTML encoding
- localStorage quota monitoring and graceful fallbacks
