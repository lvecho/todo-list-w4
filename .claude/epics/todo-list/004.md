# Task: Implement task completion, editing, and deletion

## Description
Add interactive capabilities for task management including completion toggle, inline editing, and task deletion with confirmation. Implement all user interaction patterns defined in the PRD.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Click/tap task to toggle completion status
- [ ] Double-click task text to enable inline editing
- [ ] Save edits with Enter key, cancel with Escape
- [ ] Delete tasks with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Visual feedback for all interactions
- [ ] Persistent state changes in localStorage

## Technical Details
- Implement event delegation for dynamic task interactions
- Create inline editing with contentEditable or input replacement
- Add confirmation modal for delete operations
- Include smooth CSS transitions for state changes
- Handle edge cases (empty edits, rapid clicking)
- Maintain focus and accessibility during interactions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Task creation and display must be functional

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10-12 hours
- Parallel: false (builds on task creation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Task completion toggle works reliably
- [ ] Inline editing saves and cancels properly
- [ ] Delete confirmation prevents accidental removals
- [ ] All interactions provide immediate visual feedback
- [ ] State changes persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for accessibility
