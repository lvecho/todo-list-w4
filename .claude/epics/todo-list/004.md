# Task: Implement task completion, editing, and deletion

## Description
Add interactive capabilities for task management including completion toggle, inline editing, and task deletion with confirmation. Implement all user interaction patterns defined in the PRD.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Double-click task text to enable inline editing
- [x] Save edits with Enter key, cancel with Escape

- [x] Persistent state changes in localStorage

## Technical Details
- Implement event delegation for dynamic task interactions
- Create inline editing with contentEditable or input replacement
- Add confirmation modal for delete operations
- Include smooth CSS transitions for state changes
- Handle edge cases (empty edits, rapid clicking)
- Maintain focus and accessibility during interactions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Task creation and display must be functional

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10-12 hours
- Parallel: false (builds on task creation)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Task completion toggle works reliably
- [x] Inline editing saves and cancels properly
- [x] Delete confirmation prevents accidental removals
- [x] All interactions provide immediate visual feedback
- [x] State changes persist across browser sessions
- [x] Keyboard navigation works for accessibility

## Implementation Notes
- Complete inline editing with Enter/Escape key handling
- Confirmation dialog for task deletion
- Smooth toggle animations for task completion
- Event delegation for efficient interaction handling
- Full keyboard accessibility support
