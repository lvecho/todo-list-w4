# Epic: todo-list

## Overview

A single-page web application for personal task management built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The implementation focuses on simplicity, visual appeal, and core CRUD operations with localStorage persistence. No frameworks or external dependencies required - just a clean, responsive interface that works offline.

## Architecture Decisions

- **No Framework Approach**: Pure vanilla JS for maximum simplicity and zero dependencies
- **Single Page Application**: All functionality contained in one HTML file with embedded CSS/JS or separate files
- **Client-Side Storage**: localStorage for data persistence - no server required
- **Mobile-First Design**: CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout across all devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with JS interactions
- **Component-Based Structure**: Modular JavaScript approach despite vanilla implementation

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core UI Components**:
1. **TaskInput**: Simple form with text input and add button
2. **TaskList**: Dynamic list rendering with task items
3. **TaskItem**: Individual task with toggle, edit, delete actions
4. **ProgressBar**: Visual completion rate indicator

**State Management**:
- Simple JavaScript object to hold application state
- Event-driven updates using custom events
- Direct DOM manipulation for UI updates

**User Interaction Patterns**:
- Click/tap for task completion toggle
- Double-click for inline editing
- Enter/Escape keys for edit confirmation/cancellation
- Delete with confirmation modal

### Backend Services

**Not Applicable** - Pure client-side application with no backend requirements.

### Infrastructure

**Deployment**: 
- Static file hosting (can be served from any web server)
- No build process required
- Single HTML file option for maximum portability

**Scaling**: 
- Client-side only, scales with user device capabilities
- localStorage limit (~5-10MB) sufficient for typical usage

**Monitoring**: 
- Browser console for error tracking
- localStorage quota monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

**Development Phases**:

1. **Phase 1 - Core Structure** (1-2 days)
   - Basic HTML layout and CSS styling
   - Task data model and localStorage utilities

2. **Phase 2 - CRUD Operations** (2-3 days) 
   - Task creation, display, completion toggle
   - Edit and delete functionality with confirmations

3. **Phase 3 - Progress & Polish** (1-2 days)
   - Progress tracking implementation
   - Mobile responsiveness and visual enhancements

**Risk Mitigation**:
- localStorage browser compatibility fallbacks
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

**Testing Approach**:
- Manual testing across target browsers
- Mobile device testing for responsiveness
- localStorage persistence validation
- Performance testing with large task lists

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Foundation Setup**: HTML structure, CSS framework, basic JavaScript architecture
- [ ] **Data Layer**: localStorage utilities, task data model, CRUD operations
- [ ] **Task Management**: Add, display, toggle completion, edit, delete functionality  
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: Completion rate calculation and visual progress indicator
- [ ] **UI/UX Polish**: Responsive design, animations, accessibility improvements
- [ ] **Testing & Validation**: Cross-browser testing, mobile testing, performance optimization

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**: None - pure web technologies only

**Browser Requirements**:
- ES6 support (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- localStorage API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Modern event handling (addEventListener)

**Development Dependencies**: None - can be developed with any text editor and browser

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- Task operations: < 500ms response time
- Smooth 60fps animations on mobile

**Quality Gates**:
- 100% localStorage persistence reliability
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness (320px - 1920px)
- Zero external dependencies
- Input sanitization and XSS prevention

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All PRD user stories implemented and functional
- Task completion rate displays accurately
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Interface is intuitive and requires no instructions

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline**: 4-6 days for MVP implementation

**Resource Requirements**: 
- 1 developer with HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills
- No additional infrastructure or tools required

**Critical Path Items**:
1. Data persistence layer (localStorage utilities)
2. Core CRUD operations implementation
3. Mobile-responsive styling
4. Progress tracking functionality

**Effort Breakdown**:
- Foundation & Data Layer: 40% (2-3 days)
- CRUD Operations: 40% (2-3 days) 
- Polish & Testing: 20% (1 day)
