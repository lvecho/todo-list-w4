# PRD: todo-list

## Executive Summary

A minimalist, elegant personal task management web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary focus is delivering a clean, intuitive user experience for individual users to manage their daily tasks with basic CRUD operations and task completion tracking.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Many existing todo applications are either too complex with unnecessary features or lack visual appeal. Users need a simple, beautiful tool that focuses solely on task management without the overhead of advanced features like collaboration, complex categorization, or integrations.

### Why is this important now?
- Personal productivity tools should enhance focus, not create distraction through complexity
- Web-based solutions provide universal accessibility across devices
- MVP approach allows for rapid deployment and user feedback
- Clean, aesthetic interfaces improve user engagement and daily usage

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona
**Individual Productivity User**: Personal users seeking a simple, elegant way to track daily tasks and personal projects.

### Core User Journeys

#### Daily Task Management
1. **As a user**, I want to quickly add new tasks so that I can capture thoughts without disrupting my workflow
2. **As a user**, I want to view all my tasks in a clean interface so that I can easily see what needs to be done
3. **As a user**, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress
4. **As a user**, I want to edit task descriptions so that I can update details as needed
5. **As a user**, I want to delete tasks so that I can remove items that are no longer relevant

#### Progress Tracking
6. **As a user**, I want to see my completion rate so that I can understand my productivity patterns

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Cluttered interfaces with too many options
- Complex setup processes that delay getting started
- Lack of visual feedback on progress
- Poor mobile responsiveness in existing tools

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Features
1. **Task Creation**
   - Add new tasks with text input
   - Simple, one-click task addition
   - Support for reasonable task description lengths

2. **Task Display**
   - List view of all tasks
   - Clear visual distinction between completed and pending tasks
   - Clean, uncluttered layout

3. **Task Completion**
   - Toggle completion status with click/tap
   - Visual feedback when tasks are marked complete
   - Persistent state across browser sessions

4. **Task Editing**
   - In-line editing of task descriptions
   - Save changes on blur or enter key
   - Cancel editing with escape key

5. **Task Deletion**
   - Remove individual tasks
   - Confirmation to prevent accidental deletion
   - Clean removal from interface

6. **Progress Tracking**
   - Display completion rate as percentage
   - Visual indicator (progress bar or similar)
   - Real-time updates as tasks are completed/uncompleted

#### Data Management
- Local storage persistence (no server required)
- Data should survive browser restarts
- Graceful handling of storage limitations

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- Task operations (add/edit/delete): < 500ms response time
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive performance on mobile devices

#### User Experience
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Intuitive, discoverable interface
- Minimal cognitive load
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- Clean, modern aesthetic

#### Technical
- Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript implementation
- No external dependencies or frameworks
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Progressive enhancement approach

#### Security
- Client-side only (no data transmission)
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- Safe HTML rendering

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Usability**: User can add their first task within 10 seconds of page load
2. **Performance**: All task operations complete in under 500ms
3. **Persistence**: Data survives browser restart with 100% reliability
4. **Responsiveness**: Interface works seamlessly on screens from 320px to 1920px wide
5. **Progress Tracking**: Completion rate updates accurately in real-time

### Key Metrics
- Task creation success rate: 100%
- Task persistence rate: 100%
- Mobile usability score: > 90/100
- Page load performance score: > 85/100

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No external libraries or frameworks allowed
- Client-side storage only (localStorage)
- Must work offline

### Design Constraints
- Minimalist design philosophy
- Mobile-first approach
- Single page application
- No user authentication required

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers with localStorage support
- Users primarily access via desktop and mobile browsers
- Internet connectivity not required after initial page load
- Users manage reasonable numbers of tasks (< 1000)

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Due dates and scheduling
   - Task categories or tags
   - Priority levels
   - Subtasks or task hierarchy

2. **Collaboration Features**
   - Multi-user support
   - Sharing capabilities
   - Team management

3. **Integrations**
   - Calendar sync
   - Email notifications
   - Third-party service connections

4. **Data Features**
   - Cloud synchronization
   - Data export/import
   - Backup and restore

5. **Advanced UI**
   - Drag and drop reordering
   - Bulk operations
   - Advanced filtering or search

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **None**: Pure web technologies only

### Internal Dependencies
- **None**: Standalone application

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with ES6 support
- localStorage API support
- CSS Grid/Flexbox support

## Technical Implementation Notes

### File Structure
```
index.html          # Main application page
styles/
  main.css          # Application styling
scripts/
  app.js            # Core application logic
  storage.js        # LocalStorage management
```

### Key Components
1. **Task Input Component**: Add new tasks
2. **Task List Component**: Display and manage tasks
3. **Progress Component**: Show completion statistics
4. **Storage Manager**: Handle data persistence

### Data Model
```javascript
{
  id: string,           // Unique identifier
  text: string,         // Task description
  completed: boolean,   // Completion status
  createdAt: timestamp, // Creation time
  updatedAt: timestamp  // Last modification
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Create wireframes and visual mockups
2. Develop technical architecture document
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin implementation with core CRUD operations
5. Implement progress tracking
6. Conduct usability testing
7. Deploy MVP version
